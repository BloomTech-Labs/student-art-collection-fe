Student ArtCo is an application to help schools raise money to fund their art programs by offering student art in exchange for donations. Many art students have said their finished projects end up in the garbage or collecting dust. With our app schools or art teachers can accept art donations from students and list them for sale. Family, members of the community, and art lovers can browse the art listings and connect with the school to make a donation and collect the art.

### Key Features

-    Schools can create accounts and list art created by students for sale.
-    Buyers can browse art and find pieces they like and then contact the school to make a purchase.

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React

-    State management is helpful in creating the user interface and interactions we are looking for.
-    Lots of great packages to do things effeciently.

#### Front end deployed to Netlify

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/student-art-collection-be) built using:

#### Node and PostgreSQL

-    Relational database structure will make for a clean and effecient database and schema that makes sense.

#### GraphQL

-    Allows us to get just the data we need.
-    Requests are easy to make for web, iOS, and Android so they can all get the info they would like for their needs.

# APIs

## Firebase Authentication

Firebase Authentication allows for us to have secure access to our application by our users. The users all get unique identifiers set for them that we can connect to their data in our database.

## Stripe

Industry standart for payments. Safe and secure, easy to set up, will allow customers to purchase art work easily.

## Cloudinary

Media management API will be used to upload images of the artwork

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    * REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY - Info found from Firebase App Config for your Firebase project
    * REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN - Info found from Firebase App Config for your Firebase project
